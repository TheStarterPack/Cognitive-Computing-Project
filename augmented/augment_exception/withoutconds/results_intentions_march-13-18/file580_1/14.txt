Wash hands
I go to the bathroom and locate the sink. I turn the faucet so that water is running, and rinse my hands briefly. Then I grab the soap and squeeze some onto my hands. I spend a few minutes rubbing my hands together, then I rinse them again. Finally, I turn the faucet off and wipe my hands on a towel.
