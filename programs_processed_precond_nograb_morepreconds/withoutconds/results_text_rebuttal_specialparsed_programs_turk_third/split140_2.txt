Get drink
I go to the fridge and open the door. I look for the water pitcher, and take it out, making sure to close the fridge door behind me. Then I take a pint glass out of the upper cabinet over the sink and use the water pitcher to pour a full glass of water. Then I return the pitcher to the fridge and shut the door again, and take my glass of water out of the kitche.
