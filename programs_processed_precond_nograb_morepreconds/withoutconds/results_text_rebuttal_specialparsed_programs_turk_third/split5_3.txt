Make peanut butter sandwich
I get out the peanut butter jar.  I get out the loaf of pre-sliced bread.  I get out a knife.  Get out a plate. I open the loaf of bread and get out two slices, and lay them on a plate.  I open the peanut butter jar, and using the knife, I scoop out some peanut butter, and spread it on one of the slices of bread.  I put the second slice of bread on top of the slice that has the peanut butter.
