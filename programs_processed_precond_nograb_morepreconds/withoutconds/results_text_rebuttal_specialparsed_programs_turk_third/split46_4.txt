Make ice in ice trays for freezer
Take ice trays and rinse them in the sink to make sure all debris is clear. You don't want this in your ice. Shake and/or dry with a paper towel the excess water on the ice tray so that the water droplets don't freeze on the tray. Get water either from a filtered pitcher in your fridge, the faucet in your sink, or water bottles. Fill each and every hole in the ice tray to the top with water. Carefully bring the filled ice tray to the freezer, and place it towards the back. Make sure to move any food away from the ice tray, because sometimes the ice can smell like food that's left in the freezer. Wait a few hours, and you will have ice.
