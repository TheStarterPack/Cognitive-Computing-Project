Read book
At bedtime I get my kid into her bed and tuck her in with her stuffed teddy. She picks two books and I pick one and I find the books on her shelf and bring them over to the bed. I sit on her bed with her and read each story, showing her the pictures and stopping to ask questions or talk about what she thinks about the books. When I've read all the books, I bring her more books from the shelf to read alone while she falls asleep.
